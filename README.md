# ROLLING DICES!
## Introduction

Dice game app in which the player rolls two dices in each round. If the sum of both dices is 7, the player wins the round. He loses otherwise. 
The winner is the player with the highest rate of wins.\
Development of the game is divided into a backend API and a frontend client, both deployed and hosted in separate hosting providers.
